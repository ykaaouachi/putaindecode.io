Given that a photo, depending your connection's\nquality, can be quite a PITA to load on mobile (and that the responsive image\nthing [is still a goddamn mess](http://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-hard/)),\nyou decide to put the photo below the text content so your readers can enjoy the\narticle even if the picture isn't done loading yet - even switching it for a\nlighter version in the process.\n\nIn such a case, the best solution might as well be to duplicate the `img` tag,\nand to hide one or the other with a CSS *media query* depending on the screen\nsize. Here is a dummy example:\n\n```html\n<article>\n  <h1>My awesome article</h1>\n\n  <img src=\"/my/desktop/image.jpg\" class=\"img-desktop\" />\n\n  <p>Drop a comment, mate</p>\n\n  <img src=\"/my/mobile/image.jpg\" class=\"img-mobile\" />\n</article>\n```\n\n```css\n.img-desktop {\n  /* The desktop image is hidden by default */\n  display: none;\n}\n\n@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {\n  /* On \"big\" screens, we show the desktop image... */\n  .img-desktop {\n    display: block;\n  }\n\n  /* ...and hide the mobile image */\n  .img-mobile {\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe most obvious drawback of such a solution is that content duplication means\noverweight. For purely textual stuff, depending on the size, it may be\ninsignificant. Here, I chose the worst-case scenario on purpose: an image\nshall never ever be loaded twice by our visitors. Let's cheat a bit with\nJavaScript:\n\n```html\n<article>\n  <h1>My awesome article</h1>\n\n  <!-- Those images won't be loaded since they have no src attribute -->\n  <img data-src=\"/my/desktop/image.jpg\" class=\"img-desktop\" />\n\n  <p>Drop a comment, mate</p>\n\n  <img data-src=\"/my/mobile/image.jpg\" class=\"img-mobile\" />\n\n  <noscript>\n    <!-- This image will only be loaded if our visitor has disabled JS -->\n    <img src=\"/my/mobile/image.jpg\" class=\"img-mobile img-noscript\" />\n  </noscript>\n</article>\n```\n\n```css\n.img-desktop {\n  display: none;\n}\n\n@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {\n  .img-desktop {\n    display: block;\n  }\n\n  .img-mobile {\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\n\n.img-noscript {\n  /* Let's override the desktop style to make sure\n     this image is displayed regardless of screen size */\n\n  display: block;\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar handleImages = function() {\n  // Let's load images with a data-src attribute,\n  // if they aren't yet (no src attribute)\n  // and they aren't hidden by CSS\n\n  [].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll('img[data-src]:not([src])'), function(el) {\n    if (window.getComputedStyle(el).display != 'none') {\n      el.src = el.getAttribute('data-src');\n    }\n  });\n};\n\nwindow.addEventListener('load', handleImages);\nwindow.addEventListener('resize', handleImages);\n```\n\nThis way, only the required images will be loaded with the page. The same goes\nwith `resize`; I'll admit it's kind of dirty, `matchMedia` would probably help\nus do better.\n\nFor a visitor browsing without JavaScript, we only load the mobile image: I'm\nassuming that, since we are unable to define which version of the image is\nbest for them, it's wiser to go with the lightest.\n\n## JS FTW: enquire.js\n\nThis second solution could totally be achieved without third-party tools, but\nI'd like to introduce a little library of my liking I have used previously for\nsimilar cases. It is called [enquire.js](http://wicky.nillia.ms/enquire.js/)\nand allows binding callbacks to media queries:\n\n```javascript\nenquire.register('screen and (min-width: 768px)', {\n  match: function() {\n    // The screen is 768px wide or above...\n  },\n\n  unmatch: function() {\n    // ...and here, 767px wide or below.\n    // The lib relies on matchMedia and matchMedia.addListener\n  }\n});\n```\n\nPretty neat, isn't it? Let's go through our previous example again (the CSS is\nnow unnecessary):\n\n```html\n<article>\n  <h1>My awesome article</h1>\n\n  <img data-src=\"/my/desktop/image.jpg\" data-mobile-src=\"/my/mobile/image.jpg\" />\n\n  <p>Drop a comment, mate</p>\n\n  <noscript>\n    <img src=\"/my/mobile/image.jpg\" />\n  </noscript>\n</article>\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar content = document.querySelector('p'),\n\n  switchImage = function(isMobile) {\n    var attr = isMobile ? 'data-mobile-src' : 'data-src';\n\n    [].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll('img[' + attr + ']'), function(el) {\n      // We assign one source or the other to our image,\n      // triggering its loading if necessary.\n      el.src = el.getAttribute(attr);\n\n      // We also move it before or after the text content\n      content.parentNode.insertBefore(el, isMobile ? content.nextSibling : content);\n    });\n  };\n\nenquire.register('screen and (min-width: 768px)', function() {\n  switchImage(false);\n});\n\nenquire.register('screen and (max-width: 767px)', function() {\n  switchImage(true);\n});\n```\n\nWe thus can easily handle our image's loading, as well as its position. I used\ntwo distinct handlers to make sure enquire does the job upon pageload as well,\nin any case (`unmatch` callbacks being called for resizing only, or so it\nseems: with a single handler, the image thus never appears if the page is\ninitially loaded with a screen under 768px).\n\n## That's all you've got, bitch?\n\nWe can also discuss different, moar marginal solutions, which are still worth\nquoting (given you seem to want it that bad).\n\n### Foundation\n\n[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) offers, in its fifth version (and\nmaybe even before, didn't check lol) some HTML syntactic sugar allowing to\nswitch contents for a given element (through JS).\n\nNot bad, I must say. Here it goes (from\n[the docs](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/interchange.html)):\n\n> We use the data-interchange attribute on a markup container (probably a div)\n> to do this. Here's an example which loads up a small, static map on mobile, a\n> larger static map for medium-sized devices, and a full interactive Google map\n> on large display devices.\n\n```html\n<div data-interchange=\"[../examples/interchange/default.html, (small)],\n                       [../examples/interchange/medium.html, (medium)],\n                       [../examples/interchange/large.html, (large)]\">\n  <div data-alert class=\"alert-box secondary radius\">\n    This is the default content.\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"close\">&times;</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n`small`, `medium` and `large` are just pretty names for given media queries\n(in [the docs](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/interchange.html),\nonce again. I insist.)\n\n### Flexbox (not you, David)\n\nWe also can, as judiciously pointed out by lionelB, take a closer\nlook at Flexbox, a new positioning paradigm that landed with CSS3.\n[Compatibility](http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox) isn't quite satisfying yet\n(because of IE, what were the odds) but you can still get ready! You have\npretty much nothing to do besides defining a container:\n\n```css\n.flex-container {\n  display: flex;\n\n  /* or */\n\n  display: inline-flex;\n}\n```\n\n...and assigning numbers to its children, Bangkok-style:\n\n```css\n.title {\n  order: 1;\n}\n\n.content {\n  order: 2;\n}\n\n.image {\n  order: 3;\n}\n\n/*\nYou obviously were smart enough to put your image last in the DOM...\n...weren't you?\n*/\n\n@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {\n  .content {\n    order: 3;\n  }\n\n  .image {\n    order: 2;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd there we are! No need to have graduated from Polly Pocket to understand\nhow such flexibility and code tidiness solve our problem in two goddamn\nseconds. But this is just the tip of the flexberg; there are a lot of great\nresources to walk yourself through it better than I ever could, like\n[this article](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/html5/articles/working-with-flexbox-the-new-spec.html)\nI shamelessly borrowed my snippets from.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs you saw, I wasn't able to show you any really satisfying solution: to be\nable to control an element's position in the DOM relatively to a responsive\nwebdesign, you must either duplicate it and play hide'n'seek, or move it with\nJavaScript. I would therefore be glad for you to share your opinion, ideas or\nexperiences on this topic. That will give me something to read on my spare\ntime, and you will be doing something meaningful for once!\n\nTime for me to let you go back to your life. Our paths may cross again, who\nknows? Until that day comes, I wish you some happy coding!\n","__filename":"en/articles/html/responsive-dom/index.md","__url":"/en/articles/html/responsive-dom/","__resourceUrl":"/en/articles/html/responsive-dom/index.html","__dataUrl":"/en/articles/html/responsive-dom/index.html.4866dabfe18ea444a1faffffe81985ef.json"}
